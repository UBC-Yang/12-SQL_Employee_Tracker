# 12-SQL_Employee_Tracker

## Description
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). Your assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL.
